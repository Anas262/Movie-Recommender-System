    "# Algorithm Overview: Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each movie is represented by a vector in a multi-dimensional space based on its features, which include tags derived from the overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cosine Similarity Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. It is defined mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{cosine_similarity}(A, B) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\| \\|B\\|}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the two vectors (e.g., the feature vectors for two movies).\n",
    "- \\(A \\cdot B\\) is the dot product of the vectors.\n",
    "- \\(\\|A\\|\\) and \\(\\|B\\|\\) are the magnitudes (norms) of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For a given movie, the system calculates the cosine similarity between its feature vector and those of all other movies in the dataset.\n",
    "2. Movies are then sorted based on their similarity scores, and the top N movies (excluding the selected movie itself) are recommended to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Cosine Similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Itâ€™s relatively simple to implement and understand.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: The output is bounded between -1 and 1, with 1 indicating perfect similarity.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Works well with high-dimensional data, making it suitable for text-based features like those derived from movie descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "While your current implementation focuses on cosine similarity, here are a few other algorithms commonly used in recommendation systems that you might consider exploring in the future:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaborative Filtering**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Uses user-item interactions (e.g., ratings) to recommend items based on similar users or items.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Content-Based Filtering**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Recommends items similar to those the user has liked in the past, based on item features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matrix Factorization Techniques** (e.g., SVD, NMF):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional representations to capture latent features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deep Learning Approaches**:\n",
    "   - Neural networks can be used to model complex interactions in the data, such as using embeddings for users and items.\n"
